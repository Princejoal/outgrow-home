				Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
			</h5>
			<p>
				Certain visitors to Outgrow’s websites choose to interact with Outgrow in ways that require Outgrow to gather personally-identifying information.

We primarily use our various blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Outgrow takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
