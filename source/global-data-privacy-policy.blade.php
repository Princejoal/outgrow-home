				Global Data Privacy Policy
			</div>
			<p>
			Effective Date: June 11, 2018
			</p>
			<p>
				This Global Data Privacy Policy (Policy) outlines how Outgrow collects, processes and uses
				information in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. User’s privacy and the
				confidentiality of the information that the user might obtain through or upload on the Outgrow
				Website or Application are priorities for Outgrow.
			</p>
			<p>
				Outgrow (“OUTGROW”, “we”, “us” or “our”) is committed to protecting the privacy of information of
				identifiable individuals who visit the www.outgrow.co website (the “Site”) and use the services
				available thereon (the “Services”). If we make any material change to this Policy, we will post the
				revised Policy to this web page and update the “Effective” date above to reflect the date on which
				the revised Policy became effective. Your continued use of the Services following the posting of
				any amendment to the Privacy Policy shall constitute your acceptance of such amendment.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Personal Data (“PII”) is any information concerning a specific or definable natural person. </b> Outgrow respects the data entrusted to us by our clients, vendors, suppliers, contractors, and employees and is committed to ensuring its security through fair and transparent practices.
			</p>
			<h4 class="Privacy-subheading">Statutory Regulations</h4>
			<p>
				This Policy includes the minimum standards for data privacy applicable to Outgrow. This Policy is primarily derived from the following:  
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="li-style">
					Generally Accepted Privacy Principles (GAPP)<sup>1</sup>
				</li>
				<li class="li-style">
					Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA)<sup>2</sup> model.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			However, where applicable, Outgrow seeks to exceed these standards to ensure compliance with stringent local laws, such as the European Union’s Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC)<sup>3</sup> (as implemented by local law).

			</p>
			<h4 class="Privacy-subheading">EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks </h4>
			<p>
				[Note: our Privacy Shield compliance assessment is currently underway; however, we have not yet
				completed this process.] With respect to Personal Data processed in the scope of this privacy
				policy, Outgrow complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework (the “Privacy Shield”) as
				adopted and set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the processing of personal
				data. Outgrow commits to adhere to and has certified to the Department of Commerce that it
				adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.<br/>
				To learn more about the Privacy Shield, and to view Outgrow’s certification, please visit
				<a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov" class="text-red">https://www.privacyshield.gov </a> and <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/list" class="text-red">https://www.privacyshield.gov/list</a>, respectively.
			</p>
			<p>
				In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Outgrow commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information. EU individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact Outgrow at:
				<br/><br/><a href="mailto:questions@outgrow.co" class="text-red">Questions@outgrow.co </a>
			</p>
			<p>
				Outgrow has further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to JAMS, an
				alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States. If you do not receive timely
				acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your
				satisfaction, please contact or visit <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/endispute/">https://www.jamsadr.com/endispute/</a> for more information or to
				file a complaint. The services of JAMS are provided at no cost to you.
			</p>
			<h4 class="Privacy-subheading">Privacy Principles</h4>
			<p>
				Outgrow performs the role of a data transmitter during the course of business. As a data transmitter, we transmit information on behalf of another group company or a third party. <b> Outgrow does not process sensitive PII data like credit card numbers, social security numbers etc. </b>
			</p>
			<p>
				In the context of an onward transfer, a Privacy Shield organization has responsibility for the
				processing of personal information it receives under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers
				to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. The Privacy Shield organization shall remain liable
				under the Principles if its agent processes such personal information in a manner inconsistent with
				the Principles, unless the organization proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to
				the damage.
			</p>
			<h4 class="Privacy-subheading">Choice and Consent</h4>
			<p>
				Where required by law, Outgrow obtains consent from individuals and uses that consent as the basis for the processing of PII, including to collect, use, retain, or disclose such data. <b>Individuals are given the choice to opt-in or opt-out of this procedure. </b>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>For all contact or data forms hosted on Outgrow, if required by the user and the law of the
				concerned geography, the user is allowed to add opt-in widgets with clear data privacy
				statements for end user’s reference. When required, opt-out widgets can also be added by
				the user.
				</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				Also Outgrow’s double opt-in feature allows you to obtain consent from individuals twice, once
				when filling out the form and the second opt-in can be handled via email confirmation, where the
				user receives an email confirming their interest in joining your email list.
			</p>
			<h4 class="Privacy-subheading">Consent and Information Collection and Use</h4>
			<p>
				When you join us as a user of our Services, we ask for information that will be used to activate
				your account, provide the Services to you, communicate with you about the status of your account,
				and for other purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. Your name, company name, address,
				telephone number, email address, credit card information and certain other information about you
				may be required to provide the Services or disclosed by you during your use of the Services. You
				will also be asked to create a private password, which will become part of your account
				information.
			</p>
			<p>
				By providing information to us and by retaining us to provide you with the Services, you voluntarily
				consent to the collection, use and disclosure of such information as specified in this Privacy Policy.
				Without limiting the foregoing, we may on occasion ask you to consent when we collect, use, or
				disclose your information in specific circumstances. Sometimes your consent will be implied
				through your conduct with us if the purpose of the collection, use or disclosure is obvious and you
				voluntarily provide the information.
			</p>
			<h4 class="Privacy-subheading">Information collected or contained in Outgrow created by Users</h4>
			<p>
				All the PII or any other type of information that the user might obtain through or upload on the
				Outgrow Website will be subject to our privacy policy. Even though Outgrow operates and

					maintain at least the same level of confidentiality that we maintain for such PII, and to
