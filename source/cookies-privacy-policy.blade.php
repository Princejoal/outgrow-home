				Cookie Policy
			</div>
			<p>
				This Cookie Policy explains how Outgrow and its affiliates (collectively "Outgrow", "we", "us", and "ours"), use cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our websites, including without limitation https://outgrow.co, app.outgrow.co, https://outgrow.us and any successor URLs, mobile or localized versions and related domains / sub-domains ("Client Apps/Websites") and / or our Outgrow development platform ("Platform"). It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.
			</p>
			<h4 class="Privacy-subheading">What are cookies?</h4>
			<p>
				Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website, mobile app or use an online platform. Cookies are widely used by online service providers to facilitate and help to make the interaction between users and websites, mobile apps and online platforms faster and easier, as well as to provide reporting information.
			</p>
			<p>
				Cookies set by the website and/or mobile app and/or platform owner (in this case, Outgrow) are called "first party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the website and/or mobile app and/or platform owner are called "third party cookies". Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website and/or mobile app and/or platform (e.g. like advertising, interactive content and analytics). The parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer or device both when it visits the website and/or mobile app and/or platform in question and also when it visits certain other websites and/or mobile apps and/or platforms.
			</p>
			<h4 class="Privacy-subheading">Why do we use cookies?</h4>
			<p>
				We use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our websites and/or app and/or platform to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our websites and/or app and/or platform. Third parties serve cookies through our websites and/or app and/or platform for analytics and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.

			<h4 class="Privacy-subheading">Other tracking technologies</h4>
			<p>
				We and our third party partners may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons, pixels (or “clear gifs”) and other tracking technologies. These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our websites or, in the case of web beacons, opened an e-mail that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of marketing campaigns. While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair functioning of these technologies.
			</p>
			<h4 class="Privacy-subheading">Do you serve targeted advertising?</h4>
			<p>
				Third parties may serve cookies on your computer or mobile device to serve advertising to you. These companies may use information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services that you may be interested in. They may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of advertisements. This can be accomplished by them using cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to this and other websites and/or mobile apps and/or platforms in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services of potential interest to you. The information collected through this process does not enable us or them to identify your name, contact details or other personally identifying details unless you choose to provide these.
			</p>
			<h4 class="Privacy-subheading">How can I control cookies?</h4>
			<p>
				You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Website Cookie Preference Tool:</b> You can exercise preferences about what cookies are served on our websites by clicking on the appropriate opt-out links provided in the cookie table above. You can also exercise your website cookie preferences by visiting the TRUSTe preference center by clicking this link: <a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/" class="text-red">http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/.</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Browser Controls:</b> You can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our websites though your access to some functionality and areas of our websites may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Disabling Most Interest Based Advertising:</b> Most advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of Interest Based Advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" class="text-red">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a> or <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com" class="text-red">http://www.youronlinechoices.com.</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Mobile Advertising:</b> You can opt out of having your mobile advertising identifiers used for certain types of Interest Based Advertising, including those performed by us, by accessing the settings in your Apple or Android mobile device and following the most recent published instructions. The random ID our third party partners had previously assigned to you will also be removed. This means that if at a later stage, you decide to opt-in, we will not be able to continue and track you using the same ID as before, and you will for all practical purposes be a new user to our system.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Do Not Track:</b> Some Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals. Since uniform standards for “DNT” signals have not been adopted, our websites do not currently process or respond to “DNT” signals. We take privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard. To learn more about “DNT”, please visit <a href="https://allaboutdnt.com/" class="text-red">All About Do Not Track.</a>
			</p>
			<h4 class="Privacy-subheading">How often will you update this Cookie Policy?</h4>
			<p>
				We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.
				The date at the top of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was last updated.
			</p>
			<h4 class="Privacy-subheading">Where can I get further information?</h4>
			<p>
				If you have any questions about our use of cookies or other technologies, please email us at <a href="mailto:questions@outgrow.co" class="text-red">questions@outgrow.co </a>
